        <h1>What is SE Soc?</h1>
        <p>
          Software Engineering Society (SE Soc) is a council that runs community
          initiatives within the SE program. We give you a better shot at the
          jobs you want by hosting resume critiques and interview prep sessions.
          We build a sense of community by organizing class dinners and social
          events. We introduce you to upper-years and lower-years by matching
          you with someone to chat over coffee. We highlight the cool stuff that
          everyone in SE is up to by producing our podcast, Sessions by SE.
        </p>
        <h1>Meet The Team</h1>

          B-Soc represents the odd years (SE2021, SE2023, etc.) and A-Soc
          represents the even years (SE2020, SE2022, etc.). Weâ€™re a friendly
          bunch, feel free to say hi if we ever bump into each other on campus!
