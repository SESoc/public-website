          <h1>What is SE Soc?</h1>
          <p>
            Software Engineering Society (SE Soc) is a council that runs
            community initiatives within the SE program. We give you a better
            shot at the jobs you want by hosting resume critiques and interview
            prep sessions. We build a sense of community by organizing class
            dinners and social events. We introduce you to upper-years and
            lower-years by matching you with someone to chat over coffee. We
            highlight the cool stuff that everyone in SE is up to by producing
            our podcast, Sessions by SE.

              bunch, feel free to say hi if we ever bump into each other on
              campus!
