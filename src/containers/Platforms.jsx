    Strengthening the SE community has been an important priority for me
    since I started university. Since 2015, I've personally organized events
    to try and strengthen our community with regular class dinners (past 5
    terms) and Women in SE meet-ups (past 2 terms). I've also personally
    mentored SE students through EngSoc and Women in Engineering since 2A
    because I believe 1:1 mentorship can make a big difference for students
    beginning their journey in SE. But despite these efforts, it's pretty
    hard to build community through the efforts of only one individual. Now
    that SE Soc is up and running. I want to work with all years of SE students to build a stronger community.`,
